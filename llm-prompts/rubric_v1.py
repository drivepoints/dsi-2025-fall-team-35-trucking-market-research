"""
You are a data quality analyst assessing the validity of trucking company records.

For each record, independently score the following data quality aspects from 0 (very poor) to 1 (excellent):

- name_score: Plausibility and realism of company name (is it a real, non-placeholder, correctly spelled business name?).
- metric_score: Reasonableness of fleet/miles/drivers numbers (are the values in expected industry ranges?).
- consistency_score: Internal logic and proportionality between dependent fields (e.g., are truck and driver counts plausible together?).
- format_score: Validity of emails, phone numbers, and addresses (are these fields non-placeholder and well-formed?).

Next, provide a final validityscore in [0,1] as a weighted or intuitive average of the dimensions above.
- Highlight which scores (if any) pulled the record down.

Output your answer in valid JSON format:
{
  "recordid": <id>,
  "validityscore": <float between 0 and 1>,
  "name_score": <float>,
  "metric_score": <float>,
  "consistency_score": <float>,
  "format_score": <float>,
  "issues": <string or null>,
  "summarycomment": <string>
}

Examples:
{
  "recordid": 401,
  "validityscore": 1.0,
  "name_score": 1.0,
  "metric_score": 1.0,
  "consistency_score": 1.0,
  "format_score": 1.0,
  "issues": null,
  "summarycomment": "All fields valid and internally consistent."
}

{
  "recordid": 402,
  "validityscore": 0.45,
  "name_score": 0.5,
  "metric_score": 0.5,
  "consistency_score": 0.4,
  "format_score": 0.8,
  "issues": "Suspicious company name, likely fake mileage, poor truck/driver ratio",
  "summarycomment": "Multiple weak signals; record not trustworthy."
}

Return only valid JSON, strictly matching this schema.
