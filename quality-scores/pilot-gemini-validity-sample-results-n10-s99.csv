3370169,HAULING SOLUTIONS INC,IL,1.0,,Data appears valid and consistent. MCS-150 date is recent.
992651,STEVE VUGTEVEEN,SD,1.0,,Data appears valid and consistent. Personal name as legal name is acceptable for sole proprietorships. MCS-150 date is recent.
4364971,PRECISION CUTTING,OH,0.7,MCS-150 mileage and year are missing or zero.,"Legal name seems plausible. However, MCS-150 mileage and year are missing/zero, which is unusual for an active company. Other fields appear consistent."
2932610,G & J FENCING INC,PA,1.0,,Data appears valid and consistent. MCS-150 date is recent.
3552341,LUCAS REIGEL,PA,0.8,Carrier operation is 'C' (Contract Carrier) but appears to be authorized for hire ('authorized_for_hire': 'false') and exempt for hire ('exempt_for_hire': 'true'). This could be a minor inconsistency or indicate a specialized operation.,Legal name is plausible. Mileage and driver/truck counts are consistent. The carrier operation versus authorization flags might warrant a closer look but don't render the record invalid on their own.
715899,WESTERN TURK INC,OR,0.3,"MCS-150 mileage (987,725 miles for 2022) is extremely high and potentially implausible for 9 power units. MCS-150 date is older than expected for this mileage data.","The company name and location seem plausible. However, the reported MCS-150 mileage is extraordinarily high and likely inaccurate for the reported year, significantly impacting the trustworthiness of the metrics."
3561073,OFF DUTY LOGISTICS LLC,OH,0.7,"Recent mileage is reported as 0, while MCS-150 mileage was over 123,000 for 2022. This implies a significant drop in activity not reflected in the MCS-150 date.",Company name and location are plausible. The discrepancy between reported recent mileage (0) and historical MCS-150 mileage is noted. Other fields appear consistent.
877233,CICCONE CONSTRUCTION INC,PA,0.6,"MCS-150 date (March 2013) is very old, and recent mileage is reported as 0. The 'OP_OTHER' field indicates 'APPLYING FOR MC', which might be outdated or indicate a pending status.","Company name and location seem plausible. However, the age of the MCS-150 data and the reported zero recent mileage suggest the record may not reflect current operations accurately."
4011057,JMZ TRUCKING & LOGISTICS LLC,PA,0.7,"MCS-150 mileage and year are missing or zero, despite the company being established in 2023.","Company name and location are plausible. The absence of MCS-150 mileage data is a concern for assessing operational metrics, especially given the recent establishment date."
1595892,AQUAPHORIA AQUARIUM INC,FL,0.5,"MCS-150 date is very old (2007), and recent mileage is reported as 0. The 'OP_OTHER' field indicates 'SALTWATER DELIVERY', which is likely not a trucking operation.",The company name and operation type (aquarium business) are inconsistent with a trucking company. The age of MCS-150 data and zero recent mileage further support this inconsistency. The record likely pertains to a business that is not primarily a trucking carrier.
